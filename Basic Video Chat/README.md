Vonage Video Basic Sample
=======================

This sample application shows how to connect to a Vonage Video session, publish a stream,
subscribe to a stream, and mute audio.

## Demo

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/vonage-community/video-api-web-samples/tree/main/Basic%20Video%20Chat)

Enter your credentials in `config.js` and the application will work.

> Note: There is a devDependency `sirv-cli` in the project that is only necessary to run the demo on StackBlitz.

## Running the App

*Important:* Read the following sections of the main README file for the repository to set up
and test the application:

* [Setting up the test web service](../README.md#setting-up-the-test-web-service)
* [Configuring the application](../README.md#configuring-the-application)
* [Testing the application](../README.md#testing-the-application)

## Getting an Vonage Video session ID, token, and Application ID

A Vonage Video session connects different clients letting them share audio-video streams and send
messages. Clients in the same session can include iOS, Android, and web browsers.

**Session ID** -- Each client that connects to the session needs the session ID, which identifies
the session. Think of a session as a room, in which clients meet. Depending on the requirements of
your application, you will either reuse the same session (and session ID) repeatedly or generate
new session IDs for new groups of clients.

*Important*: This demo application assumes that only two clients -- the local Web client and
another client -- will connect in the same Vonage Video session. For test purposes, you can reuse the
same session ID each time two clients connect. However, in a production application, your
server-side code must create a unique session ID for each pair of clients. In other applications,
you may want to connect many clients in one Vonage Video session (for instance, a meeting room) and
connect others in another session (another meeting room).

**Token** -- The client also needs a token, which grants them access to the session. Each client is
issued a unique token when they connect to the session. Since the user publishes an audio-video
stream to the session, the token generated must include the publish role (the default). For more
information about tokens, see the Vonage Video [Token creation
overview](https://developer.vonage.com/en/video/guides/create-token).

**Application ID** -- The Application ID identifies your Vonage developer account's application.

Upon starting up, the application executes the following code in the app.js file:

```javascript
// See the config.js file.
if (APPLICATION_ID && TOKEN && SESSION_ID) {
  applicationId = APPLICATION_ID;
  sessionId = SESSION_ID;
  token = TOKEN;
  initializeSession();
} else if (SAMPLE_SERVER_BASE_URL) {
  // Make a GET request to get the Vonage Application ID, session ID, and token from the server
  fetch(SAMPLE_SERVER_BASE_URL + '/session')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => {
    applicationId = json.applicationId;
    sessionId = json.sessionId;
    token = json.token;
    // Initialize an Vonage Video Session object
    initializeSession();
  }).catch((error) => {
    handleError(error);
    alert('Failed to get Vonage Video applicationId, sessionId, and token. Make sure you have updated the config.js file.');
  });
}
```

This method checks to see if you've set hardcoded values for the Vonage Video Application ID, session ID, and
token. If not, it makes a GET request to the "/session" endpoint of the web service.
The web service returns an HTTP response that includes the session ID, the token, and Application ID
formatted as JSON data:

    {
         "sessionId": "2_MX40NDQ0MzEyMn5-fn4",
         "applicationId": "67c891c9-5ab5-4c20-b4dd-5d277dee9a9e",
         "token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJmYWI2MTZhMi1hZmIyLTQ0OWQtOWZhNy01..."
    }

For more information, see the main README file of this repository.

## Connecting to the session

Upon obtaining the session ID, token, and Application ID, the app calls the `initializeSession()` method.
First, this method initializes a Session object:

```javascript
// Initialize Session Object
const session = OT.initSession(applicationId, sessionId);
```

The `OT.initSession()` method takes two parameters -- the Vonage Video Application ID and the session ID. It
initializes and returns an Vonage Video Session object.

The `connect()` method of the Session object connects the client application to the Vonage Video
session. You must connect before sending or receiving audio-video streams in the session (or before
interacting with the session in any way). The `connect()` method takes two parameters -- a token
and a completion handler function:

```javascript
// Connect to the session
session.connect(token, (error) => {
  if (error) {
    handleError(error);
  } else {
    // If the connection is successful, publish the publisher to the session
    session.publish(publisher, handleError);
  }
});
```

An error object is passed into the completion handler of the `Session.connect()` method if the
client fails to connect to the Vonage Video session. Otherwise, no error object is passed in, indicating
that the client connected successfully to the session.

The Session object dispatches a `sessionDisconnected` event when your client disconnects from the
session. The application defines an event handler for this event:

```javascript
session.on('sessionDisconnected', (event) => {
  console.log('You were disconnected from the session.', event.reason);
});
```

## Publishing an audio video stream to the session

Upon successfully connecting to the Vonage Video session (see the previous section), the application publishes an 
audio-video stream (Vonage Video Publisher object) to the session. This is done inside the completion handler for the 
connect() method, since you should only publish to the session once you are connected to it.

The Publisher object is initialized as shown below. The `OT.initPublisher()` method takes three
optional parameters:

* The target DOM element or DOM element ID for placement of the publisher video
* The properties of the publisher
* The completion handler

```javascript
// initialize the publisher
const publisherOptions = {
  insertMode: 'append',
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%'
};
const publisher = OT.initPublisher('publisher', publisherOptions, handleError);
```

Once the Publisher object is initialized and successfully connected, we publish to the session using the `publish()`
method of the Session object:

```javascript
session.publish(publisher, handleError);
```

## Subscribing to another client's audio-video stream

The Session object dispatches a `streamCreated` event when a new stream (other than your own) is
created in a session. A stream is created when a client publishes to the session. The
`streamCreated` event is also dispatched for each existing stream in the session when you first
connect. This event is defined by the StreamEvent object, which has a `stream` property,
representing the stream that was created. The application adds an event listener for the
`streamCreated` event and subscribes to all streams created in the session using the
`Session.subscribe()` method:

```javascript
// Subscribe to a newly created stream
session.on('streamCreated', (event) => {
  const subscriberOptions = {
    insertMode: 'append',
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%'
  };
  session.subscribe(event.stream, 'subscriber', subscriberOptions, handleError);
});
```

The `Session.subscribe()` method takes four parameters:

* The Stream object to which we are subscribing
* The target DOM element or DOM element ID (optional) for placement of the subscriber video
* A set of properties (optional) that customize the appearance of the subscriber view
* The completion handler function (optional) that is called when the method completes
  successfully or fails
